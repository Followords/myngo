#### <a name="about">About</a>
Myngo is a web administration interface for MongoDB. It is written in Python runs on Tornado and uses jQuery on the front-end. It is released under the new BSD license.

#### <a name="running">Running Myngo</a>
To run Myngo, you have to install [Tornado](http://www.tornadoweb.org/) and [pymongo](http://api.mongodb.org/python/1.5%2B/installation.html). Then just download Myngo, do <code>$ python run.py</code> and go to http://localhost:8000.

#### <a name="#features">Features</a>
For now you can view, clone, drop or repair all DBs, view, drop, rename and validate collections in each database and view some server info.
 
#### <a name="plans">Plans</a>
Planned features, in no particular order, heavily inspired by [MongoDB docs](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/UI):

 * collections: datasize, indexsize
 * indexes
 * queries - explain() output
 * security: view users, adjust
 * see replication status of slave and master
 * sharding
 * system.profile viewer ; enable disable profiling
 * curop / killop support
 * pagination
 * interactive shell
 * search box that accepts queries
 * AJAXify everything
 * improve the UI
 * options from the command line, not only conf.py
 * read from the mongod stdout and display it
 * GridFS support
 * better error handling/reporting
 * in DB listing, after a action ends, modify the table with JS (currently, there's a redirect to /, which is cheap and easy solution, but not sexy)
 * refactor the code in myngo.js as there's a lot of repetition - maybe it can be done better
